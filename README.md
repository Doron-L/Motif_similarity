# Motif_similarity

We estimate the similarity and its significance (P-value) between two sets of motifs. The similarity is taken to be one minus the Shannon-Jensen distance. More specifically we follow the procedure presented in Itzkovitz et al. 2006, "Coding limits on the number of transcription factors".
